                    <p>Champion select: Tournament draft, unless stated as otherwise</p>
                    <p>Bans per team: 3</p>
                    <p>Map: Summoners’ Rift (5v5)</p>
                    <p><strong>Roles:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Follow the Summoners’ Code or be disqualified.</li>
                        <li>Teams: Sign up as a groups of 5. There are no substitutes. Having a player log into another player’s account due to that player being unavailable and playing the match is against the rules and will result in disqualification. Smurfing to circumvent the rules is grounds for disqualification.</li>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <strong>Showing Up for a Match:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Online:</b>Failing to show up to a match within 5 minutes after the designated start time will lead to disqualification. Check-in for a match begins 10 minutes before the match. Failing to show up during check-in before the game’s set start time equates to forfeiting the first of the 3 games. If teams ends up missing check-in and are not present 10 minutes after the designated start time, then the match is forfeit by that team.</li>
                        <li><b>At The LAN:</b> The time of the match is to be announced. Players will bring their own computers and peripherals. They will be responsible for having their own stuff. Players are understood as attending the LAN for more than simply this tournament, so it is expected that the players are able to play the match whenever during the LAN. But to clarify, after the time is announced, is a team is unable to make it to the LAN or members are not present, penalties will be given accordingly. If players do not have all their gear ready by the time the match is set to start, penalties will be assigned.
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>5 minute late - Lose 1 ban. </b>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>10 minute late - Lose 2 bans. </b>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>15 minute late - Game loss. </b>

This is an absolute requirement and players will be prevented from playing until they have the above. Players are required to wear their headset/earbuds/headphones covering or in their ears during the games. This is a measure to help ensure relatively smooth play.</li>
                        <li>Teams will contact each other when it comes to inviting one another to the game.</li>
                        <li>Collusion or intentionally losing a game between two teams is not allowed and is grounds for disqualification.</li>

                        <li>In-game pausing is limited to 5 minutes per pause and a total of 3 pauses per match. Subject to change in accordance to making the game fair. Ex. Broken keyboard, mouse, computer, ete. Before unpausing a game, the team that needs the pause must notify the opposing team. Before ending a paused game state, the team that will be un-pausing the game must first ask the other team if they are ready. When both sides are ready, the game can be un-paused. Note: the team that did not initiate the pause should stay at their computer and should not go away from their keyboard and be ready to resume when the issue at hand is resolved. </li>

                        <li>If there is a random disconnect in game, a restart will not be justified.</li>
